1. Explain stack? Which are the applications of stack?
ANS:
Application of the Stack
A Stack can be used for evaluating expressions consisting of operands and operators.
Stacks can be used for Backtracking, i.e., to check parenthesis matching in an expression.
It can also be used to convert one form of expression to another form.
It can be used for systematic Memory Management.

STACK:
A Stack is a linear data structure that holds a linear, ordered sequence of elements. 
It is an abstract data type. A Stack works on the LIFO process (Last In First Out), i.e., 
the element that was inserted last will be removed first. 
To implement the Stack, it is required to maintain a pointer to the top of the Stack, 
which is the last element to be inserted because we can access the elements only on the top of the Stack.

2. State various realtime applications of stack
ANS:

Examples of realtime application
The stack of trays in a cafeteria;
A stack of plates in a cupboard;
A driveway that is only one car wide.

Examples of stacks in computing:
Back/Forward stacks on browsers;
Undo/Redo stacks in Excel or Word;
Activation records of method calls;
